This pattern helps you form numbers like 'thirteen', 'fourteen', and so on.\n\nHow to use:\n- Memorize the pattern: Add '-надцать' after the number from 10 to 9.\n- Use common teen numbers for age or time, such as ‘одиннадцать’ (11) for 'eleven', and ‘двенадцать’ (12) for 'twelve'.\n- Practice with examples: Say 'Мне двенадцать лет' ('mne dvinadtsat let') for 'I am twelve years old'.\n\nEdge cases:\n- Be aware that numbers like 16 and 19 have irregular forms. For example, sixteen is ‘шестнадцать’ ('shestnadtsat’) not *‘шестнадцатьть'*, and nineteen is 'девятнадцать', not a combination of 9 and 10.\n\nUsage Notes: \n- Teen numbers can be used for age or time, but remember the pattern always applies.",
