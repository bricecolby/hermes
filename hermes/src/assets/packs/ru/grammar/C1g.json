For example, if you say 'He said that he would come late,' ensure that 'he' and 'would come' both refer correctly to the same person.\n- Use commas consistently in your sentences. In Russian, punctuation is a major cue for parsing complex structures, so make sure your commas are placed correctly.\n\nEdge cases:\n- Be careful with reflexive pronouns (e.g., 'сам' or 'себе') and reciprocal pronouns ('друг другу'). Ensure they match the subject in number and case. For instance, 'они помогли друг другу' (they helped each other).\n\nHow to do it:\n- Plan your sentence first: main clause → subordinate 1 → subordinate 2 → subordinate 3.\n- Track who/what each pronoun refers to; repeat the noun when needed to avoid ambiguity.\n- Use commas consistently; in Russian, punctuation is a major cue for parsing deep syntax.",

      "summary": "C1 performance objective: Use inversion for rhetorical emphasis appropriately",
      "explanation": "Target behavior: Use inversion for rhetorical emphasis appropriately.\n\nMeaning:\n- Inversion means rearranging parts of a sentence to emphasize something specific, like moving the verb or subject to the beginning of the sentence. This technique can make your points clearer and more engaging.\n\nHow to use:\n- Before reordering, decide what is **topic** (given) and what is **focus** (new/contrastive). For example, in 'We’ll talk about the student later; right now the method matters more,' the topic is talking about a student, while the focus is on the importance of the method.\n- Use particles like **именно**, **вот**, or **же** sparingly to mark emphasis. In 'It’s this factor, not the amount of data, that determines model quality,' **это** and **не** are used to emphasize the key point.\n- After reordering, check if pronouns still agree with their antecedents and ensure clarity. This is important because shifting focus can sometimes make sentences confusing or unclear.\n\nEdge cases:\n- Be careful not to overload a single sentence when two simpler ones would be clearer. For example, instead of 'The project was successful only due to the team’s hard work,' consider saying, 'Due to the team’s hard work, the project was successful.'\n- Avoid overusing particles like **именно** or **же**, as this can sound too forceful and unnatural in Russian.\n\nHow to do it:\n- Identify what is already known (topic) and what you want to highlight (focus).\n- Use word order and particles like **именно, вот, же** sparingly for emphasis.\n- Check pronoun references after reordering to maintain clarity and agreement.",

For example, in 'объяснение' (explanation), the root is 'ясно' (clear).\n- **Maintain semantic role consistency:** Ensure that when you change the form of a word, you keep its function or role within the sentence intact. For instance, if 'объяснение' means an action, use forms like 'объяснение' for the result and 'объяснять' for the process.\n- **Register appropriateness:** Choose more abstract derivations in formal contexts; opt for concrete words in semi-formal settings.

This makes the argument more persuasive by adding a personal touch.\n- **Mix Sentence Lengths:** Longer sentences can handle complex ideas, while shorter ones can emphasize key points or punchy conclusions.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Be cautious with long sentences that might become confusing due to overloading. Break them into two if necessary for better clarity and readability.\n- Avoid pronoun ambiguity by using clear nouns when referring back to ideas already discussed in the argument.\n- Ensure agreement in case, number, and gender of words throughout your argument to maintain grammatical accuracy.",
