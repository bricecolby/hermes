Then, practice them with new vocabulary and sentences you create yourself.\n\n- When focusing on the object, move it to the beginning of the sentence.\n- For time adverbials, put the specific time at the start for emphasis.\n- To contrast subjects, use а before one subject to set up a comparison.\n\n**Edge cases:** Be careful with case agreement and verb endings. Avoid starting sentences with certain words like numbers or pronouns unless they are the object of focus.\n\n**Usage notes:** Watch out for correct case agreement and verb conjugations. Use these patterns in both questions and statements, but be mindful of their formal register.",

      "summary": "про + accusative",
      "explanation": "Meaning: The accusative case with про is used to express an action or state completed in a certain period of time, focusing on the duration.\n\nHow to use:\n- Learn the *meaning/function* first (why this case is used). The accusative with про indicates that you have spent a certain amount of time waiting for something or performing an action.\n- Then learn the *form* on high-frequency nouns/pronouns/adjectives that appear with it. For example, 'час' means 'an hour,' and when used in this construction, it takes the accusative case.\n\nEdge cases:\n- Be aware of other prepositions that select different cases (e.g., после + Genitive, к + Dative, о + Prepositional).\n- Pronouns and adjectives must match the case too, not just the noun. For instance, if you use 'час,' both 'час' and any accompanying pronoun or adjective should be in the accusative form.\n\nExample: Я ждал автобус час. (I waited for the bus an hour.)\n- Here, 'час' is in the accusative case to indicate the duration of waiting.\n\nExample: Я жду тебя. (I'm waiting for you.)\n- This example uses a pronoun with the verb 'ждать,' which requires the accusative form ('тебя').",

For example:\n- Я всегда читал книги. (I always read books.)\nWhen referring to specific, completed events, use perfective verbs. Example:\n- Я уже прочитал эту книгу. (I already finished reading this book.)\n\nEdge cases: Be cautious with time words like 'уже', which often push towards the perfective aspect. For example, `не делал` means 'didn’t do' regularly, while `не сделал` implies not doing something once.\n- Imperfective verbs can describe habitual actions in the past, like `я часто ездил в гости`.

For instance: Вы должны прийти на встречу.\n- To express purpose, use чтобы followed by an infinitive.

      "explanation": "What it does: Purpose clause with чтобы.\n\nA2 learners often need to express their intentions politely and clearly. The purpose clause with чтобы is a key tool for this. It helps you convey what you want or plan to do, making your speech more polite and natural.\n\nMeaning:\n- To show the goal of an action: 'I am doing something so that...'.\n- To make requests or suggestions: 'May I do something so that...'.\n\nHow to use:\n- Use чтобы with verbs in their past tense form, even when expressing a hypothetical.\n- Common phrases include: 'Я бы хотел чтобы', 'Мы могли бы чтобы', etc., followed by the infinitive of another verb (e.g., говорить).\n- When making polite requests or suggestions, use бы and can precede the clause with 'если' for conditions.\n\nEdge cases:\n- Be careful not to confuse the purpose clause with other uses of чтобы. For instance, 'Чтобы я понял вас' means 'So that I understand you', rather than a purpose.\n- Avoid using чтобы immediately after nouns or pronouns, as it sounds unnatural (e.g., *Нужно чтобы говорить - wrong).\n\nNote: With бы, Russian typically uses the past tense form even though the meaning is “would/could”.",

(If I finish my work, I will go to the movies.)\n- Combine with other clauses for more complex sentences:\n  - Conditional clauses can follow statements: Я знаю, что он дома, если он не пойдет на встречу. (I know that he's at home if he doesn't go to the meeting.)\n  - Time clauses: Когда я свободен, я гуляю. (When I'm free, I walk.)\n\nEdge cases:\n- Watch for agreement and decline in relative clauses with который. For example: Это человек, который мне помогал. (This is the person who helped me before.)\n- Be mindful of punctuation rules; put a comma before subordinate/relative clauses.",
