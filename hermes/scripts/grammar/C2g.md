## C2 Grammar – Refined Behavior-Based Performance List

### A. Real-Time Structural Recalibration

1. Restructure a complex sentence mid-production without grammatical breakdown.
2. Reformulate a sentence spontaneously to increase precision or nuance.
3. Shift fluidly between hypotactic and paratactic structures within discourse.
4. Compress or expand a structure bidirectionally without loss of meaning.
5. Maintain structural precision during spontaneous topic shifts.
6. Use ellipsis and substitution naturally in extended discourse.
7. Sustain syntactic accuracy under real-time self-repair.

---

### B. Rhetorical Framing and Interpretive Control

8. Foreground or background information through structural positioning.
9. Create controlled structural ambiguity without causing misinterpretation.
10. Shift narrative or argumentative perspective grammatically.
11. Use marked word order to produce irony, contrast, or emphasis.
12. Embed evaluation implicitly through syntactic framing.
13. Reframe statements to imply distance, skepticism, or alignment.
14. Control interpretation scope through clause hierarchy.

---

### C. Extreme Aspect–Modality Precision

15. Adjust aspect choice to subtly alter implied stance.
16. Layer epistemic and deontic modality without redundancy.
17. Sustain high modal density without interpretive confusion.
18. Distinguish micro-nuances between near-synonymous modal constructions.
19. Reinterpret earlier modal meaning in light of new discourse context.
20. Calibrate obligation strength grammatically without lexical exaggeration.

---

### D. Stylistic and Genre Agility

21. Switch syntactic style seamlessly between academic, literary, bureaucratic, and conversational modes.
22. Imitate genre-specific syntactic conventions convincingly.
23. Deviate from neutral word order intentionally for stylistic effect.
24. Modulate syntactic rhythm for rhetorical pacing.
25. Blend stylistic registers without structural inconsistency.
26. Sustain stylistic voice across multi-paragraph discourse.

---

### E. Lexico-Grammatical Innovation and Precision

27. Infer meaning of unfamiliar prefixed or derived forms from morphology and context.
28. Interpret rare or archaic derivational forms accurately.
29. Create new derived forms appropriately within productive word-formation patterns.
30. Exploit derivational morphology to refine semantic precision.
31. Maintain lexical cohesion while varying surface expression.
32. Avoid semantic drift across extended lexical chains.
33. Reformulate abstract vocabulary into concrete equivalents and vice versa.

---

### F. Long-Range Cohesion and Text Architecture

34. Sustain referential clarity across multi-paragraph discourse.
35. Manage demonstrative reference precisely across distant textual spans.
36. Maintain thematic progression across extended text sections.
37. Integrate multiple argumentative strands into unified discourse.
38. Reorganize discourse structure while preserving logical coherence.
39. Adjust structural density dynamically across sections of text.
40. Maintain cohesion despite structural experimentation.

---

### G. Pragmatic and Stance Calibration

41. Convey stance implicitly through grammatical structure rather than explicit markers.
42. Use grammatical framing to imply presupposition strategically.
43. Calibrate distance from reported speech syntactically.
44. Balance explicitness and implication in argumentation.
45. Sustain interpretive consistency despite rhetorical shifts.

---

46. Adjust grammatical complexity based on assumed reader expertise.
47. Reframe discourse for different communicative purposes (analysis, persuasion, narration).
48. Maintain coherence and precision while shifting register under rhetorical pressure.
